# JOI COde base exploring

- Extreme OOP in Javascript
- Whole project in Javascript, then export typescript types seperately
when consumers optionally want them

Basic process I wanted to analyse was the most familiar use case for JOI
ie. 
1. declaring a JOI object with some keys and JOI types
2. then validating another object with this type

## General summary of code structure
Declaring a JOI object has crazy inheritance which initialises a bunch of custom methods on an object
and a heirarchical initilisation of the child keys and JOI objects.
